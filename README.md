# Learning Centre Course Pre-Work Page

Courses developed by the Learning Centre often require learners to 
visit a web page before attending a course session to consume 
designated pre-work reading or other context-setting activities.

The pages in this repo act as templated starting points for developers
to implement consistent-looking pages in an efficient but customizable
way. To begin with, there will probably be just one page, but this could
grow as needs dictate.

When a new course requires a new landing page, the developer will fork 
this repo (naming it with the course abbreviation), navigate to the 
desired spot (probably on the "Kepler" server), and clone their fork 
into place. Then they can create the new page, add all the files, and 
commit everything back (or not depending on content as these are public).
